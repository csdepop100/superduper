            I decided to use a wrapper class for the money in my application as I am not familiar
            with the details of how the financial world represents it in practice. I think using
            a wrapper like this allows me to adapt to different ways of handling money in code
            more easily.

            I was torn between using floating point numbers or integers, as integers are not as
            prone to have disgusting rounding errors (0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3). I was thinking about using integers to count
            the "cents" and then just shift the comma in the representation.
            In the end I decided to use floating point numbers to keep it simple for now, should
            the need for more safety arise this is the place to adjust it.

            During testing, I actually ran into the floating point issue. I resolved it here by adjusting
            the precision of my equals method.
